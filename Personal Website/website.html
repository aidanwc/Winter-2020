        <h1> Project Info </h1>
        <p>I am interested in working on the Market Project, currently I am applying for summer internships
            and would like an applicable project that I could show on my resume. For this reason I would be interested in creating
            a web-page for an online store. In terms of a specific topic, I would be interested in a service booking store 
            in which there is a limited number of specialty service-workers(inventory) and the workers can be booked (purchased) for a specific time 
            and price. This would be interesting as the inventory for the day would depend on the number of registered workers. I am currently in 
            COMP 421 and believe that the database design principals taught in that class would be useful for this marketplace's implementation.

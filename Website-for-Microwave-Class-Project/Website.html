        <section>
            <p> What are Microwaves?
                Microwaves are electromagnetic waves that travel through space at the speed of light,
                 have a frequency within the range of 1 gigahertz to 1 terahertz and a wavelength between 1 mm and 1 m. 
                 Microwaves can be used for communication, navigation, radar, radio astronomy, spectroscopy
                (the science of the interactions between matter and electromagnetic radiation) and, heating and power applications. Microwaves are used primarily for TV broadcasting, 
                radar for air and sea navigational aids, and telecommunications including mobile phones (WHO, 2016). They are also used in kitchens for cooking food, for example, in microwave ovens,
                like most of us own. In microwave ovens, a component called the magnetron generates microwaves from electricity inside the microwave oven. (Spector, 2014). In microwave ovens,
                the microwaves are generated at the right frequency to penetrate the food, and heat it by twisting water molecules back and forth, and into each other, creating friction, which produces heat.
                We can't see microwaves, but if you could, you would see the microwave cooking chamber light up with an intense glow (Spector, 2014).

        <h1> Why Microwaves        </h1>
        <section>
            <p> Microwaves, at the wavelength they are produced at in microwave ovens (about 12cm in length) 
                are easily absorbed by most foods to heat them up. They can produce heat (through friction) 
                in many different things we put in microwaves such as liquids, solids, or different kinds of foods 
                (sugars, salts, etc.)  Additionally microwaves, unlike other kinds of rays (such as x-rays or ultraviolet rays)
                 do not have enough energy to damage the food molecules, or cause physical harm to us, such as cancer.

        <h1> Why Different Foods Heat Differently in Microwaves     </h1>
        <section>
            <p> 
                Microwaves are so popular and useful in cooking due to their ability to quickly heat all types of food.
                 Most microwaves have a glass turntable inside so the food heats evenly. Microwaves form ‘standing waves’ 
                 that are essentially static columns of energy (Abdelrahman, 2019), so the turntable ensure the waves are distributed 
                 throughout the entire food contents. Meat, for example, is an item that should not be heated/cooked in a microwave;
                  uneven cooking can leave some frozen/raw parts uncooked, attracting bacteria. Automatic defrost and pre-programmed 
                  settings can take the guesswork out of making meals, because sensors can calculate cooking time based on the amount 
                  of steam the food emits (Abdelrahman, 2019). It is also worth mentioning that cooking nothing can be harmful as well; 
                  the magnetron would absorb the waves and the microwave could break or catch fire. Furthermore, hard-boiling an egg in
                   the microwave could be problematic－the steam inside the egg would have nowhere to go and could explode.
                    The rate of heating depends on the power rating of the oven and on the water content, density and amount of food
                     being heated (World Health Organization, 2016).

        <h1> Why certain materials should not go in the Microwave </h1>
        <section>
            <p> One must be cautious regarding what they put in a microwave. 
                A metal object that is placed inside the oven deflects the microwaves away from the food; 
                metal placed inside a microwave can also become very hot (Zimmerman, 2010). 
                You may even hear metal popping and sparking if it is in the oven. This is due to microwaves producing a concentrated electric 
                field at corners or an edge of a metallic object, ionizing the surrounding air (Zimmerman, 2010). 
                Lastly, plastic and non-microwave safe tupperware should not be put in the oven. 
                If it were to melt into the food/liquid contents, you may be consuming harmful toxins.
